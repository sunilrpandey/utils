# Docker Notes
## What is it?
Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.

### Docker Engine 
The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine. 

### Image and Container
From object oriented perspective we can consider image and class and container as an instance of it.

You might ask, how a container provides the required environment with isolation if it shares the OS kernel. Well, that is done with the help of images.

Letâ€™s take an example here. If your app only needs Python 3.5 from the system, you will only need that in your production environment as a dependency. Everything else will be an extra overhead. So, Docker provides the template built on the Linux kernel with the needed dependencies only and nothing is installed in that template. That template is called an image.

## How Docker is so useful
- Consistent and uniform dev/test environment
- Cross plateform packages
- Runtime scalable 
- Identification and encapsulation of dependencies 
- Reusable images

## How to run Docker then ?
### Well, install it first
Need help? follow me -> [Installation Guide](docker_installation.md) 

## Run a container for Hello-World image 
Identify and test hello-world image available on hub.docker.com. 
> docker run -it hello-world

Generally image name is followed by tag but one can skip it if it is latest, that means above code can be written as 
> docker run -it hello-world:latest

for other examples  
> docker run -it ubuntu:v1

Here -i means interative, -t means terminal, ubuntu is image name , v1 is tag

In practice it checks if image is available on local machine if not, it pulls the image from docker hub and runs the container. i.e. it runs 

### What are other container options
Get detail using 
> docker container --help

but few of those very handy to use are here, provide __container_id__ which can be noted from _docker ps_ command. 
- attach : Attach local standard input, output, and error streams to a running container
- commit : Create a new image from a container's changes
- diff : Inspect changes to files or directories on a container's filesystem
- exec : Run a command in a running container
- inspect : Display detailed information on one or more containers
- kill : Kill one or more running containers
- logs : Fetch the logs of a container
- rename : Rename a container
- rm : Remove one or more containers
- run : Run a command in a new container
- start : Start one or more stopped containers
- stats : Display a live stream of container(s) resource usage statistics
- stop : Stop one or more running containers
- top : Display the running processes of a container

### How to come out of container 
__Ctrl + P__, __Ctrl + q__ to come out of container without killing the container, __Ctrl + d__ to exit

### Check running containers 
```
docker ps 
docker ps -a //for history
```
one can achieve same this using 
```
docker container ls 
docker container ls -a //for history
```

## What about images? how to check image lists
> docker images

Other image options
- build       Build an image from a Dockerfile
- inspect     Display detailed information on one or more load        Load an image from a tar archive or STDIN
- ls          List images
- prune       Remove unused images
- pull        Pull an image or a repository from a registry
- push        Push an image or a repository to a registry
- rm          Remove one or more images
- save        Save one or more images to a tar archive (streamed to STDOUT by default)
- tag         Create a tag TARGET_IMAGE that refers to SOURCE_IMAGE

## Few use cases
### Show images list
> docker images
### Rename image
Change name,tag or both
```
docker tag hw:latest hw:v1//give new name
docker tag hw:latest hello:v2
```
### Remove image 
> docker rmi image_name:tag //cam use image id as well

> docker rmi <image_id> // use -f for force delete 

but you can not remove if a container of this image is running, sometime not as it can not be as it can be attached

If you see many untagged images and you need to clean up, run 
> docker image prune 

### Hey, I want to share my docker image to my friend
1. Save image to tar fil my hare, other guy need to load it see the image in images list(seen using `docker images`)
```
docker save <image_name> -o taranme
docker load -i <taranme>
```

2. Upload it to registry
